An android app to check for the availability of blood in your city.
Using this app requests can also be made for the type of blood group required by the user.
It is a very intuitive app .
A free webhost hotstringer was used .
I didnt use firebase as I wanted to learn more about hosting app on a less optimised source.
Please change the webhost to your the desired host.
I will add a PPT soon so the app becomes clear to understand.
